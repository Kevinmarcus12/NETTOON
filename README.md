**🎬 NETTOON: Your Online Domain for Free Cartoons and Animations Only**



Welcome to Nettoon — the world’s first free video streaming platform built exclusively for cartoons and animations.

These are the first official lines of code for the Nettoon platform — a dedicated space created for cartoon and animation lovers across the globe.

🚀 What is Nettoon?
Nettoon is a free, user-driven video streaming application that allows users to:

📤 Upload

📺 View & Stream

🔗 Share

their favorite cartoon and animation content from anywhere in the world.

🎯 Our Vision
We aim to be the first-ever video streaming platform focused entirely on cartoons and animations.
For far too long, animated content enthusiasts have lacked a dedicated platform to call home.

Nettoon changes that — by creating a digital world solely for animation lovers.

❌ What Nettoon is NOT
🚫 No other form of content is allowed.
✅ Only cartoons and animations.
This ensures a clean, focused space free from distractions and clutter.
